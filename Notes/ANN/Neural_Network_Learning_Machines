Write an up-to-data treatment of Neural Network in a comprehensive, thorough, and readable manner.

Chap 1.
The perceptron, the multilayer perceptron, self-organizing maps, and the neuro-dynamics, to name a few topics, have always been considered integral parts of neural networks, rooted in ideas inspired by the human brain.

kernel methods, exemplifired by support-vector machines and kernel principal components analysis, are rooted in statistical learning theory.

Ideas drawn from neural networks and machine learning are hybridized to perform improved learning tasks beyond the capabiliyt of either one operating on its own.
