\section{RESEARCH WORK}

My major research area is within the field of stochastic hydrology and model evaluation, or put it another way, is to apply the ideas in probability theory, statistics, information theory and system theory to study the distribution of water at different spatial and temporal scales.
The  specific works I did are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item Comparison of Parameter Optimizing Algorithms~(Gene Algorithm, Particle Swarm Optimization, Shuffled Complex Evolution)
\item Conceptual Hydrolocal Model Comparison
\item Streamflow Simulation Using ARMA
\item Precipitation Simulation using Compound Poisson Process 
\item Theoretical and Numerical Forward-Reverse Mann-Kendall Mutation Test
\item Stochastic Soil Moisture Modelling Using Chapman-Kolmogorov equation
\item Temporal and Spatial Hydrological Scaling, a Stochastic Perspective 
\item Hydrologcal Model Diagnosis By Mapping the Hydrological Pattern to Information Space
\end{itemize}          
The theme of my graduate proposal is to make a scale analysis of watershed hydrologic simulation based on stochastic soil moisture model. With a compound poisson process precipitation stimulation, I try to construct a basic stochastic description of the hydrological process, in which the effort of including new observations and specifying detailed processes could be evaluated in a Bayesian view. Traditional distributed hydrological models take the philosophy of stepwise integration for the irregular meteorological condition and complex constitutive function controlling the movement of liquid, which easily lose their power in capturing a general hydrological pattern. In this research, a stochastic function describing the temporal and spatial pattern of the watershed is brought out and loaded in the basic function, providing a more theoretical beautiful 
result. The outcome is examined by measuring the mutual information between the inputs, outputs and observations of the modelling basin at different scales.
